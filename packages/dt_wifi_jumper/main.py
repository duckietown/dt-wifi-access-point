        This function sends a sequence of bits to GPIO_OUT and expects it in from GPIO_IN.
        It keeps checking this until GPIO_IN is always at 0 (jumper is off) or the sequence
        is successfully transferred from GPIO_OUT to GPIO_IN (jumper is on).

        This is needed because sometimes the GPIO_IN reports 1 even with no jumper on.
